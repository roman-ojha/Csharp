    *) Logical Operator
        -> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators
        -> Unary ! (logical negation) operator.
        -> Binary & (logical AND), | (logical OR), and ^ (logical exclusive OR) operators. Those operators always evaluate both operands.
        -> Binary && (conditional logical AND) and || (conditional logical OR) operators. Those operators evaluate the right-hand operand only if it's necessary.

    *) Comparison Operator
        -> The < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal), and >= (greater than or equal) comparison, also known as relational, operators compare their operands. Those operators are supported by all integral and floating-point numeric types.
